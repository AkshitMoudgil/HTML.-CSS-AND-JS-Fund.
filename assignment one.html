<h1>Song- Thunder(lyrics)</h1>By Imagine Dragons

<!-- p tag used to separate each line-->
    <p>Just a young gun with a quick fuse</p>
    <p>I was uptight, wanna let loose</p>
    <p>I was dreaming of bigger things and</p>
    <p>Wanna leave my own life behind</p>
    <p>Not a "Yes sir", not a follower</p>
    <p>Fit the box, fit the mold</p>
    <p>Have a seat in the foyer, take a number</p>
    <p>I was lightning before the thunder</p>
    <p>Thunder, thunder
    Thunder, thun-, thunder
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
    Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder</p>
<p>Thunder, feel the thunder
    Lightning and the thunder
    Thunder, feel the thunder
    Lightning and the thunder
    Thunder, thunder
    Thunder</p>
<ul>
    <li><h2>Stanza 2</h2></li>
</ul>
    <p>Kids were laughing in my classes</p>
    <p>While I was scheming for the masses</p>
    <p>Who do you think you are?</p>
    <p>Dreaming 'bout being a big star</p>
    <p>They say, "You're basic", they say, "You're easy"</p>
    <p>You're always riding in the backseat</p>
    <p>Now I'm smiling from the stage while</p>
    <p>You were clapping in the nosebleeds</p>

<p>Thunder, thunder, thun-
    Thunder, thun-thun-thunder
    Thunder, thunder
    Thunder, thun-, thunder
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder</p>
<p>Thunder, feel the thunder
    Lightning and the thunder
    Thunder, feel the thunder
    Lightning and the thunder
    Thunder</p>
<p>Thunder, feel the thunder
    Lightning and the thunder, thunder
    Thunder, feel the thunder
    Lightning and the thunder, thunder
    Thunder, feel the thunder
    Lightning and the thunder, thunder</p>
<p>Thunder, feel the thunder (never give up, never give up)
    Lightning and the thunder, thunder (never give up, never give up)
    Thunder, feel the thunder (never give up, never give up)
    Lightning and the thunder, thunder (never give up)</p>
<p>Thunder, thunder, thun-
    Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
    Thunder, thunder, thun-
    Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
    Thunder, thunder, thun-
    Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
    Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder</p>
